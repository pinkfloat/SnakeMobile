# SnakeMobile

This source code uses Swift UI to generate a functional app  
of the famous handygame "Snake" that can be run on any newer  
iphone / ipad that is able to digest swift code.

I added the xcode project too, just in case, that you want to emulate  
an i-device of your choice on your computer.

The game provides additional settings to change the speed and size of the game.  
Scores will be saved within a highscore table.

Since you are reading this, let me use this opportunity to state,  
that I don't claim ownership of graphics and sounds used in this software.

You can find all of my sources within the /Snake/img and /Snake/sounds  
directories in the respective "Source_and_Terms_of_use.txt" files.
